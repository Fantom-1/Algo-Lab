# AI-Powered Algorithm Visualizer

This is an advanced, AI-driven web application that generates and animates visualizations for a wide range of algorithms on the fly. Simply describe an algorithm, and the application leverages the power of the Gemini API to create a custom, interactive D3.js visualization.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Fantom-1/Algo-Lab.git](https://github.com/Fantom-1/Algo-Lab.git)
    cd Algo-Lab
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project, including React, Vite, and Lucide Icons.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your API Key:**
    This project requires a Gemini API key. The application is currently configured to leave the API key field blank, as the environment it's running in injects it automatically. For local development, you would typically manage this with an environment variable.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    This command will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the address shown in your terminal) to see the application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1.  **Enter an Algorithm:** In the "Algorithm" input field, type the name of the algorithm you want to visualize (e.g., "Bubble Sort", "A* Search", "Merge Sort").
2.  **(Optional) Provide Data:** In the "Input Data" field, you can provide your own dataset. The format should be descriptive (e.g., a space-separated list of numbers for sorting `8 2 9 4 5`, or a description of a graph for pathfinding `A-B:2, B-C:4`).
3.  **(Optional) Provide Arguments:** Use the "Additional Arguments" field for specifics like start and end nodes (e.g., `Start: A, End: C`).
4.  **Visualize:** Click the "Visualize" button.
5.  **Interact:** Use the control panel on the left to play, pause, or step through the AI-generated visualization.
